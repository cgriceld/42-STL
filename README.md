# 42-STL

42 С++ project to reimplement some STL containers: vector, map and stack.

⚠️ Map is not finished yet.\
📌 According to subject, the code is limited by C++98 standard.

* recoded containers have `ft` namespace
* iterator system is as well fully reimplemented
* the structure and approach of the original container is respected as far as it's possible

## tests

`test` folder has some tests that compare output and timing with original containers.
* `bash test.sh` - run vector and stack tests
* `bash clean.sh` - delete auxiliary files created for tests

Sample test output:
